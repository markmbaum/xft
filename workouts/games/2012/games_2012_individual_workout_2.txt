In this event, athletes will begin by swimming approximately 700 meters with fins. They will then grab their bicycles and ride approximately 8 kilometers across undulating terrain, with approximately 400 meters through unrideable soft sand. They finish with an 11 kilometer dirt-road run across steep hills with over 1,400 feet of elevation gain.

Pendleton 2 will be ranked by total time to finish the entire swim, bike and run race. Arrival order at the checkpoint (Pendleton 1) will have no bearing on the scoring for Pendleton 2.
