They will then grab their bicycles and ride approximately 8 kilometers across undulating terrain, with approximately 400 meters through unrideable soft sand. They finish with an 11 kilometer dirt-road run across steep hills with over 1,400 feet of elevation gain.

Pendleton 1 will end at the checkpoint approximately 150 meters into the run. Athletes will receive points based on their arrival order at the checkpoint. There is no scheduled rest at the checkpoint as the race continues.
