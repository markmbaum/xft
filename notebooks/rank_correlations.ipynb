    "This notebook contains some interactive plots for exploring/comparing rank correlations between athlete height and placement in the CrossFit Games and the elite stratum of the Open. [Rank correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient) measures how similarly *ordered* two vectors are. For example, if the shortest person wins a workout, the second shortest person takes second, all the way down to the tallest person to who finishes last, that workout would have a perfect positive rank correlation of one (1). In this case, the smallest height values correspond perfectly with the smallest placement values, so the correlation is *positive*. Conversely, if a workout's placements are strictly *descending* in height (tallest person winning, second tallest taking second, ..., shortest finishing last) then the rank correlation is exactly negative one (-1). Everything in between these extremes will yield rank correlation coefficients between -1 and 1, and 0 indicates no correlation at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each rank correlation coefficient comes with a [p-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient#Determining_significance) assessing its statistical significance. This value roughly indicates the probability of finding a correlation at least as extreme as the one that was found by accident when there is no actual relationship. If you repeatedly, randomly shuffled the results and recomputed the correlation, you would see a lot of values around 0 but occasionally some larger values too, just by chance. Each p-value gives a sense of how likely its correlation is to be the product of chance, just a fluke, so lower values are better. Take the p-values with a grain of salt, though, especially for relatively small samples like workouts with only 10 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data include results for all Games and Open workouts with **more than 5** recorded height values in the individual Men's and Women's divisions. I exclude the second stage of the 2020 Games (5 people) and any other occasions where almost all the height values are unavailable. Correlations in these cases are just not very meaningful. I took the top 2500 finishers in each Open workout, so they have much larger samples, but **all** of the correlation values are approximate. Just in that case, taking the top 2500 in each Open workout was arbitrary and taking the top 200 or some other number would undoubtedly change the correlations a bit. More generally, lots of things affect placements/performance and we shouldn't make any overdramatic inferences. As I'll point out below, there are some repeated workouts in both the Games and Open, which can help calibrate our confidence a little bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's definitely best to look at this on a wider screen and not a touch screen. All of the graphics allow zooming, panning, hovering and other interaction. Use the little toolbars on the right to change the action/tool. The plots were all made using [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) in Python."

In 2017 its correlation in the Men's division was `0.44`, but in 2018 it was `0.32`. So it looks like that workout is better for shorter athletes, but it's not clear that it is *exactly the 9th best workout for short athletes* or whatever other very specific conclusions you could make. Open workouts have better numbers, so their correlations ought to be more stable, and I'll point out an example in the next plot.\n",
    "* I put vertical lines in each panel where the correlations flip from positive to negative. This is interesting because it gives a sense for what *overall fraction* of the workouts tilt toward tall/short athletes in each case. The Men's Games look pretty balanced, but the Women's Games workouts seem a little tilted toward *tall* athletes in aggregate. The Open workouts are a bit tilted toward short athletes in both divisions. Another way to see this would just be to look at the median workout, which is at the very center of each panel. For example, the median correlation at the Women's Games is a workout that slightly favors tall people.\n",
